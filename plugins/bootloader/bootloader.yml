  parameters:
    architecture:
      type: string
      description: The processor architecture to bootload (the only supported value is `arm`).
      default: arm

    ram-start:
      type: uint32
      description: |
        Start address of the system memory.
        The bootloader will use this address as a base address to load payloads such as the kernel or the DTB.
      default: 0

    kernel-load-addr:
      type: uint32
      description: |
        Specify the kernel load address. If this option is not specified,
        the bootloader will choose an address it thinks to be safe.
      default: 0

    dtb-load-addr:
      type: uint32
      description: |
        Specify the DTB load address. If this option is not specified,
        the bootloader will choose an address it thinks to be safe.
      default: 0

    machine-id:
      type: uint32
      description: |
        The machine ID written to register r1, used by Linux to know which machine it is running on.
        This parameter is only used when booting without DTB.
      default: 0

    blob:
      type: string
      description: |
        The binary blob template used by the bootloader, generated and copied to 0x0.
        Valid values are:
          - simple: For simple, monoprocessor ARM boards
          - vexpress: For Versatile Express-like boards
      default: simple
